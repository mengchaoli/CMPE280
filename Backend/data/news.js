            "title": "Is Coronavirus Airborne?",
            "body": "Aspeople everywhere scramble to keep a safe distance from one another (or not), scientists are hard at work trying to figure out whether the coronavirus is airborne. While they agree that coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing can expel tiny droplets of moisture that can contain the virus, it isn’t quite clear how long those droplets hang in the air. Today in the journal Nature, however, researchers from Wuhan, China, offer a bit of clarity. In their small study of the air in two Wuhan hospitals and some public areas, they found that fragments of the virus can indeed stay airborne in droplets — in some places more than others. Specifically, they found particles of viral RNA (the genetic material of the virus) in these droplets. Notably, there’s no evidence yet that these viral RNA particles can cause a Covid-19 infection. Between February 17 and March 2, they collected 30 samples by setting up “aerosol traps” — gelatin filters for catching tiny particles in the air — in specific areas of two Wuhan hospitals, including patient wards, patient toilets, and the rooms where staff take off protective equipment. They also sampled the air in public zones in Wuhan, like the areas outside grocery stores, residential buildings, pharmacies, and hospitals. Using a technique for amplifying genetic material from even the most minute samples, the researchers identified the types of areas that had the highest levels of viral RNA. Ventilation appears to play a big role, the paper suggests: Ventilated patient isolation wards and rooms had “very low” levels, but levels in patients’ toilet areas, which weren’t ventilated, were “elevated.” The rooms where hospital staff removed their protective gear also had high concentrations of viral RNA, the authors write, but these dropped to “undetectable levels” after the hospitals started more rigorous sanitization. This suggests that, although viral RNA on their equipment can be resuspended in the air, thorough cleaning effectively gets rid of it. All but two of the public areas they tested had “undetectable” levels of viral RNA. The two exceptions were two areas that were prone to crowding: a site about three feet from the entrance to a department store that customers frequently passed through, and a site next to a hospital where patients often walked by. The authors chalk up the presence of viral RNA at these sites to infected",

            "body": "nearly March, I sent a note to someone at Google and called a board member there to ask if their phones could be used to help people trace their whereabouts to help limit the spread of Covid-19. At the time we had dozens of cases. Hundreds of cases seemed like it was in the distant future. I was telling governors I thought the cases would be eventually in the tens or hundreds of thousands. I actually remember cutting the word millions because no one would find it credible. It already seemed impossible that we would do as well as South Korea. “Italy is our future”, someone who had studied the numbers told me. The only path to hold the numbers down was if people stopped it from spreading. So we launched the #StayHome campaign. It felt like the most immediate, but almost desperate, step. No state had implemented any lockdown orders. Our letter asked people to take things into their own hands and policymakers to follow. To do this, I reached out to signatories to get people’s attention. And people who understood social media and media. And we relentlessly called governors. Things happened fast. Cases grew. We were asking people to do something that would take weeks to begin to work.“The public won’t go for it.”“This isn’t China.” I was told all of these things by more experienced people . All I could think was; “We don’t have a choice.” The question for Google was the wrong one. I knew one person who knew the CEO’s of Google and Apple. Most people had one of those phone systems. “Would they work together?” This person said they would try. Yes! Technology would rescue us! I so wanted to believe that. I was looking for silver bullets. If I’m honest, I was looking for the feeling of accomplishment. But I was lying to myself.",

            "body": "Deaths across America spiked as Covid-19 began its spread, and many were never attributed to the new coronavirus, researchers reported Monday. 'Notable increases' in deaths were seen in March and early April, the team led by the Yale School of Public Health found. This was especially true in New York and New Jersey, states hard-hit by the pandemic. The study was first reported by the Washington Post. Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the team found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19. 'That is close to double,' Dan Weinberger, who studies the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Yale, told CNN.The team could not show whether the increased deaths were due to coronavirus, Weinberger said. But there are strong indications that they were. For instance, the team also looked at data on doctor visits.What we see is that in many states, you see an increase in influenza-like illnesses, and then a week or two later, you see an increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza,' Weinberger said. 'It provides some confirmation that what we are seeing is related to coronavirus.Plus, in especially hard-hit states such as New York and New Jersey, where coronavirus is known to have spread widely and infected many people, overall deaths were far in excess in what would normally have been expected in March.In New York City, this discrepancy was even more stark, with three to four times as many excess all-cause deaths as pneumonia and influenza deaths, the team wrote. Some states, such as New York, seemed to keep up with the Covid-19 deaths. The state reporting of deaths in the pandemic closely tracked what the Yale team found. But others did not. For instance, California had 101 reported deaths due to COVID-19 and 399 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths, the team wrote in a preprint published online in MedRxiv (pronounced Med Archive).The new coronavirus causes respiratory disease, and deaths would presumably be listed among the regular reports of deaths and illness from pneumonia and influenza. But doctors are increasingly reporting other, sometimes fatal, symptoms from Covid-19, including strokes, kidney failure and heart damage. Patients already weakened by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease may have had a death listed as being due to one of those causes, rather than coronavirus.",
